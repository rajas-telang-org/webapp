## Overview

This project implements a REST API to manage assignments. The API allows authenticated users to create, update, and delete assignments. Additionally, it enforces certain constraints on assignment points, user permissions, and ensures secure storage of user account information.

## User Requirements

    - Users can create an account by providing email, password, first name, and last name.
    - The account_created field is set to the current time upon successful user creation.
    - Users cannot set values for account_created and account_updated; any provided values for these fields are ignored. Passwords are  never returned in the response payload.
    - Users should use their email as their username. Attempting to create an account with an existing email results in a 400 Bad    request response.
    - Passwords are securely stored using the BCrypt password hashing scheme with salt.
    - Users can update their account information, including first name, last name, and password. Attempting to update other fields results in a 400 Bad Request response.
    - The account_updated field is updated upon successful user update.
    - Users can only update their own account information.
    - Retrieve user information, excluding the password.
    - Users can retrieve their account information, excluding the password.
